The game consists on a 2D visualization, that using parallax scrolling creates the image of obstacles falling. The player is locked at the bottom of the screen and can jump between both left and right borders to avoid the objects, that will be synchronized with the music beats, so that the ideal time to jump is at the actual beat.
